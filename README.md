Springboard Data Science Career Track Projects

This is project is for the exercises for the Unit 5.2.4 JSON wrangling assignment

Problem 1) Count the number of unique values in the countries column and return the top 10 rows

Problem 2) json_normalize works with a dictionary of lists, which is the format of each row in the
           'mjtheme_namecode' column. I iterate through the column and append each mini dataframe 
           to the previous to get a dataframe with the theme codes and names
           
Problem 3) Filter out each code number throughout the mjthemes dataframe created in the 2nd exercise
           and forward/back fill the empty strings in the filtered data. concatenate them and sort the index.
           count the unique values and return the top 10 rows.
